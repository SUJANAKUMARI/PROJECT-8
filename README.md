## DATA VISUALIZATION

1.  WORD CLOUD OF MOST FREQUENT WORDS IN JOB TITLE

2.  Distribution of Hourly rates

 Business or Analytical Implications:
Majority of Workforce Earns Low Wages: Policies or skill improvement programs could focus on helping workers move into higher-paying jobs.
High-Paying Jobs are Rare: Industries or roles that command high rates should be explored for better career recommendations.
Potential Salary Cap Considerations: Companies may need to re-evaluate pay structures to ensure fair distribution of wages.

3. Top 20 Countries by Job Postings
The data could be influenced by job platforms focusing more on English-speaking countries.
The demand for remote work and freelancing could be contributing to job postings in countries like Pakistan and the Philippines.

4. Number of Job Postings Over time

INTERPRETATIONS:
The early February jump might indicate when the platform started tracking job postings.
The cyclic nature suggests companies might be posting in batches, possibly following hiring trends such as end-of-month or start-of-week job openings.
Some industries (e.g., tech, retail) have seasonal hiring trends that could explain the fluctuations.

5. Hourly Vs. Fixed Price Jobs

INTERPRETATION:
While both payment models are widely used, hourly jobs dominate the market slightly, showing a trend toward flexible work arrangements. However, fixed-price jobs remain a substantial portion, appealing to those who prefer structured, results-based compensation.

## KEYWORDS AND SALARY CORRELATION

Specific Observations:
Positive Correlations: Keywords like "developer," "expert," "specialist," "marketing," and "editor" show strong positive correlations with salary. This suggests that roles involving these skills or expertise are likely to command higher compensation. "Video," "designer," and "youtube" also exhibit moderate positive correlations, indicating that these areas might contribute to higher salaries but to a lesser extent.
Negative Correlations: "Needed" and "looking" show negative correlations. This might indicate that these terms are more prevalent in job postings with lower salary ranges. Neutral Correlations:
Many keywords like "design," "create," "wordpress," and "app" have correlation coefficients close to zero, suggesting a weak or no relationship with salary.

## ARIMA FORECAST FOR TOTAL JOBS

INTERPRETATION

# PROPHET FORECAST FOR REMOTE JOBS

Overall Interpretation:
This graph shows a forecast of remote job postings using the Prophet model, a time series forecasting tool developed by Facebook. The key takeaway is that the model predicts a continued upward trend in remote job postings, with both a clear upward trajectory (represented by the dark blue line) and a range of possible future values (the light blue shaded area).

Possible Interpretations:
Continued Growth of Remote Work: The forecast strongly suggests that the trend of increasing remote job opportunities will continue. This could be driven by factors like technological advancements, changing work preferences, and companies embracing remote work models for various benefits. Relatively Consistent Growth: The linear nature of the forecast suggests a steady and consistent increase, rather than explosive growth or decline. Uncertainty Increases with Time: The widening confidence interval is a natural feature of forecasting. It implies that the model is more certain about near-term predictions and less certain about long-term ones.
